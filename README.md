Checkers Game This is a simple implementation of the classic board game, Checkers, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Game Rules The game is played on an 8x8 board with alternating black and white squares. Each player starts with 12 pieces on the dark squares of the board. The pieces move diagonally and can only move forward towards the opponent's side of the board. If a player's piece reaches the opposite side of the board, it becomes a King. Kings can move both forward and backward. A player can capture an opponent's piece by jumping over it to an empty square on the other side. The game ends when a player has no more valid moves, either because all their pieces have been captured or they are blocked from moving.
