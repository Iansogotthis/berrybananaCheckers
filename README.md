Project 1 GA Checkerboard JS rendered board

need to tie the DOM into the JS
currently  builds a chessboard and adds event listeners to each piece. The function creates a div for each row and column, and then adds a piece to each square. The piece is given a class name based on its color (white or black) and whether it is occupied. The function also sets the row and column attributes of each piece, and adds an event listener to each piece that calls the  movePiece  function when clicked. 

/*am here
line 147
function isValidMove(currentRow, currentColumn, targetRow, targetColumn) {
  isValidMove()  // Return true if the move is valid, false otherwise
  // You can use the current state of the board array to validate the move
  // For example, check if the target position is empty and if the move follows the rules of the game
  // Modify this function according to your specific game rules and requirements

  // Placeholder comment for move validation logic
  // ...

  return true; // Placeholder return statement
}
